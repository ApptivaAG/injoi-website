## Hosts are very happy to have injoi

The hosts are very happy to have injoi because it allows them to serve their guests faster. In addition, it is possible to offer ordering with injoi exclusively at tables that are a little further away and thus only having to bring the food and drinks to these tables. The staff no longer has to take the orders or collect the payments.
